# eAR: Educational Augmented Reality App

*eAR* is an educational app that utilizes Augmented Reality (AR) to enhance learning experiences. Developed in Unity with Vuforia engine, this app allows users to scan specific images to view 3D models and access detailed information about various subjects.

## Features
- **AR Learning**: Explore subjects through interactive 3D models.
- **Image Tracking**: Scan images to unlock content.
- **Ground Plane Tracking**: Place 3D models in the real world.

In the "Getting Started" section of your README file, you should provide clear, step-by-step instructions on how users can set up and run your project on their own machines. Here's an example tailored to your eAR project:
